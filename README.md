Memo Guru is an app to create, store and to train memo cards.

You can use it to learn foreign languages, coding shortcuts or whatever else you can store on two sides of a memo card.

The project is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

The project has a backend directory with all the backend files and a frontend directory with the React files.

I started this project on Monday, 15-08-2022.
